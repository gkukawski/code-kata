# You can immediately see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH"
# is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is
# to give to the man a simplified version of the plan.
# A better plan in this case is simply:

# ["WEST"]
# or
# { "WEST" }
# or
# [West]
# Other examples:
# In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"],
# the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH"
# is going north and coming back right away.

# The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST"
# annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).

# In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH"
# and "SOUTH" are not directly opposite but they become directly
# opposite after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST"
# so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].

# Task
# Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings
# and returns an array of strings with the needless directions
# removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

# The Haskell version takes a list of directions
# with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
# The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
# The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.
# See more examples in "Sample Tests:"
# Notes
# Not all paths can be made simpler.
# The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"]
# is not reducible. "NORTH" and "WEST", "WEST" and "SOUTH", "SOUTH"
# and "EAST" are not directly opposite of each other and can't
# become such. Hence the result path is itself :
# ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].
